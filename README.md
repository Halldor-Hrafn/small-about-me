## a bit of story about the repository
So, you decided to read til the end, huh? well, nice that you did, I wanted to write some stuff about this project because I like writing some long stuff on the README. So let me tell you a story about my grand project to create a website for myself. The project started when I got a bit curious and checked on Linode and AWS and saw that they had some pretty good deals on servicing websites, so I talked to my friend on Discord and he told me about Netlify, which seems to be a very good deal, and so I got to working on a barebone structure, I asked on a Discord groupchat for what interesting things they would want to see on the websites, and they gave some... interesting ideas, some notable examples are... a fap counter (why?), and a map that shows registered sex offenders in a 2km radius, which, ain't a bad idea, but I have no idea how I would get an API for that to work. another idea was to mirror some Reddit subreddits, which doesn't seem that bad but I can't find reliable API's for it. so here I was, staring at a computer screen with no ideas for what to have on the website, so I did the most ADHD thing ever and completely forgot about it for 2 months. it is now mid-December 2022 and now I got a spark of motivation to make it, and so I got to work again, but... I wasn't satisfied at all whatsoever, and so procrastinated, like a person with ADHD would do. It was also at this time when I recently got a Mastodon account and started posting some.. posts? is that what you call them on Mastodon? anyways, that doesn't matter, that brings us to today (1st of January 2023), and I am writing this story that probably no one would read anyways, but hey, if you the reader are reading this, do give me a DM on Mastodon at @mrpottsuwu@fosstodon.org , I will be glad to hear that you read this completely useless story :)
